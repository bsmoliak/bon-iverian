bon-iverian: Bon Iver lyrics generator
======================================

**bon-iverian** is a Python package that uses markov chains to compose Bon
Iver-like lyrics. It is a work in progress initiated as the final project of
the Codecademy Python course. The package utilizes Codecademy's `markov_python
<https://github.com/Codecademy/markov_python>`_ text generator as a submodule.
The general idea is to combine Bon Iver's discography and Markov chains to seed
a new song.
