# bon-iverian
A python application that uses markov chains to compose Bon Iver-like lyrics

This is a work in progress initiated as the final project of the Codecademy Python course. This project utilizes Codecademy's [markov_python](https://github.com/Codecademy/markov_python) text generator as a submodule.

The idea is to combine Bon Iver's discography and Markov chains to seed a brand new song. Since it's been so long.
